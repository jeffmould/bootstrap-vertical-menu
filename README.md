=======================

Vertical drop down menu for Twitter Bootstrap 3

Instead of creating a standard horizontal menu bar with Twitter Bootstrap 3, this is a vertical menu with collapsible
drop downs. 

The menu runs down the left side with the content to the right. 

It is fully-responsive and switches to a horizontal menu on mobile devices (screen sizes below 768px).
